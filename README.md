# CryptoLib
Cryptography-related project.  Vigenere, stream, and RSA decipher.  

There are three standalone applications:
 - **Vigenere**: A tool for decrypting Vigenere cipher. It is possible to decrypt any Slovak or English texts and obtain an unknown password. 
 - **StreamCipher**:  A stream cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt a given amount of data. This tool can encrypt/decrypt data with a given key. There is also the possibility to decrypt encrypted text without the key by a brute-force attack.
 - **RSA**: It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that is considered as the most secure way of encryption.
